            Nick Care was a much-loved trumpet player, educationalist, band
            director, teacher and friend. There will be a charity concert to
            celebrate his life at <b>6pm on Sunday 5th March 2023</b> at the Waterside
            Theatre, Exchange Street, Aylesbury, HP20 1UG, in aid of the Motor Neurone
            Disease Association (MNDA).
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>UPDATE:</b> Tickets are available NOW from the <a

          <p>
            We would like as many people whose lives were touched by Nick to
            come together and celebrate Nick and all the amazing music he
            brought to our lives so please save the date now and <strong
              >share this site far and wide</strong
            >!
          </p>
          <p>
            Please see the <a href="/gallery">gallery</a> page for some pictures
            of Nick and the various groups he conducted and played with.

          <h3>MNDA donations</h3>
          <p>
            Concert tickets are priced as low as we dared, to enable as many
            people to come as possible at Â£18 Adult &amp; Â£11.75
            Students/Children/ Registered unemployed. Rather more than I hoped
            to charge, but this includes the theatreâ€™s various per ticket
            charges (but not the online transaction charge Â£2.25, which is not
            per ticket but per order).
          </p>
          <p>
            If you feel able &amp; have not done so yet, you might wish to
            donate something to the MNDA in memory of Nick via <a
              href="https://justgiving.com/team/NickCareConcert"
              target="blank"
              referrerpolicy="no-referrer"
              >Nick Care Concert fundraising for Motor Neurone Disease
              Association on JustGiving</a
            > or if you canâ€™t attend, you might like to donate instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weâ€™ve asked the MNDA to earmark the majority of funds raised for
            research, with some also going to help the Bedfordshire Group of
            MNDA, who helped Nick so much with equipment and general support.

            <h3>Who will play at the concert?</h3>
            Anyone who played in a band that Nick directed is invited to play in
            this concert. Performers will be grouped into:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Big Bands directed by <a
                  href="https://www.julesbuckley.com/"
                  target="_blank"

                > (Metropole Orkest, BBC Symphony Orchestra, BBC Proms conductorâ€¦
                and AMC Dance Band member)
              </li>
              <li>
                A Brass/Wind Band playing two of NickÊ¼s Band compositions,
                directed by Kathy Gifford (strings etc. welcome as well?!)
              </li>
            </ul>
            Performers will be able to listen to the concert when not performing.
            Itâ€™s great that there are a lot of people who want to play. Although
            it will depend on how many people play specific instruments, itâ€™s likely
            that most people will play in just one or two pieces plus the massed
            finale. This means that on the day there may be long gaps between your
            rehearsals &amp; the concert.
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Will there be rehearsals?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Saturday 4th March: Some rehearsals for some performers (at
                Aylesbury Music Centre, Walton Road, Aylesbury, HP21 7ST).
              </li>
              <li>
                Sunday 5th March: Morning &amp; Afternoon for all performers
                (from c. 11am TBC at the Theatre).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Further information with the specific pieces that weÊ¼ll ask
              specific performers to play will be emailed in early 2023. A
              rehearsal schedule will be emailed to performers in the new year
              once itÊ¼s been worked out! Performers will have seats reserved in
              the Upper Circle so they can listen when theyÊ¼re not playing.
