            Nick Care was a much-loved trumpet player, educationalist, band
            director, teacher and friend. There will be a charity concert to
            celebrate his life at <b>6pm on Sunday 5th March 2023</b> at the Waterside
            Theatre, Aylesbury or at a Bedfordshire venue (location TBC) in aid of
            the Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA).
          </p>
          <p>
            We would like as many people whose lives were touched by Nick to
            come together and celebrate Nick and all the amazing music he
            brought to our lives so please save the date now and <strong
              >share this site far and wide</strong
            >!
          </p>
          <p>
            Please see the <a href="/gallery">gallery</a> page for some pictures
            of Nick and the various groups he conducted and played with.

            <h3>Who will play at the concert?</h3>
            Anyone who played in a band that Nick directed is invited to play in
            this concert. Performers will be grouped into:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Big Bands directed by <a
                  href="https://www.julesbuckley.com/"
                  target="_blank"
                  referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Jules Buckley</a
                > (Metropole Orkest, BBC Symphony Orchestra, BBC Proms conductorâ€¦
                and AMC Dance Band member)
              </li>
              <li>
                A Brass/Wind Band playing two of Nick's Band compositions,
                directed by Kathy Gifford (strings etc. welcome as well?!)
              </li>
            </ul>
            Performers will be able to listen to the concert when not performing.
            We hope that a lot of people will want to play. In this case, it's likely
            that most people will play in just one or two pieces plus the massed
            finale. This means that on the day there may be long gaps between your
            rehearsals & the concert.
